I am a musician and composer. I am primarily a guitarist interested in creating music that apply textures, loops, found sounds, and accidental sounds.

I've always had an interest in creating and recording music.   Even as a young teen, I was experimenting creating music using multiple cassette decks to simulate overdubbing.   Things changed significantly when I was able to purchase an early 4 track cassette recorder (Fostex X15).   I used that Fostex extensively to record both my own music as well as create demo tracks for area bands.

In addition to my own solo efforts I have collaborated with a number of different people over the years.   The most notable collaborations being Bits of Food (aka BOF),  Baku, and Name with No Sound.
