Music is my hobby. I enjoy creating, playing, and recording music both by myself and with others.

I've been making music since the early 80's. I've always been fascinated by creating and recording music.  I am not much into playing music made by others.  Around the house I'll occasionally pick up the guitar to play along with a CD but I've never had the desire to be in a cover band.  I have played in bands since I was a teen back in the early 80's (yes I am that old).  Past bands include Bits of Food and Baku.  Lately I've been working on a new project called Name with No Sound with Mark Favro
