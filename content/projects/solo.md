# Solo Projects
Ever since I started playing guitar I was more interested in playing music I made up rather than learning a bunch of other people’s songs.   Mostly though I’ve focused on playing in a group setting.  

The initial lockdown at the start of the COVID pandemic gave me the opportunity to record a CD of my own material. [Quarantine Sessions](https://awarrenpratten.bandcamp.com/album/quarantine-sessions) is an collection of songs and ditties I had written over the years. Some were intended to be used in my band [Name with No Sound](/projects/namewithnosound). Others are just pieces I created but never did anything with. I decided to use the period of self isolation to record and share them. 
In the spirit of keeping things simple the goal was to perform the pieces live into a mic. No overdubs, no post processing etc. 

Since then I have spent some time focusing on my own song craft by creating guitar pieces I can and could play wholly.
