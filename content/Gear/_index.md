I am not really a gear hound.  I like to keep things simple.

## Guitars

### Red
One day while walking home from high school I stopped in the London Guitar Shoppe and saw a guitar I absolutely fell in love with.  A used Yamaha SJ-550.  This was around 1986.  I told my dad about the guitar and I believe the next day we went up and he bought it for me.  This guitar has been with me ever since and I'll never part with it because of the sentimental value it holds.  Red has been my primary guitar ever since and I used it all the way through Baku.    It is a Tele style guitar with a fixed bridge.  It has two tap-able humbucking pickups.

### Lynn
I remember distinctly watching the Woodstock movie when I was around 14 and being completely blown away by Jimi Hendrix's performance.  One the stage he played an olympic white Fender Stratocaster with a maple neck.  That guitar was the inspiration behind "String Thing #2" and honestly probably propelled me into the life of guitar playing ever since.  Strats were it.  I never got myself a Strat either because of expense or what have you. When I was 37 I was loaned the book "The Stratocaster Chronicles" which I read cover to cover.  It completely renewed my love of Strats.  My wife listened as I talked in detail about the guitars and on my 40th birthday she and my son presented me with my own Strat.  An American Series Fender Stratocaster with olympic white body and a maple neck.  I named the guitar "Lynn" which is my wife's middle name.  This guitar has been my primary guitar ever since.

## Amplifiers

### Fender Princeton Reverb 

What can I say?  This amp is the sound that I hear in my head.  End of story.



## Pedal Board

My pedal board is simple and designed for maximum flexibility.

### Line 6 M9

A very flexible multi-fx pedal that provides a wide range of different effects.

Primary effects leveraged:
* Reverse Delay
* Auto-volume Delay
* Digital Delay
* Particle Reverb
* Tube Drive
* Pi Fuzz
* Volume Pedal
* Pitch Vibrato
* Script Phaser

### Eventide Black Hole

I am definitely a reverb junky.   The Line 6 M9 has solid reverbs that I love and my Princeton has an incredible tube driven spring reverb but I wanted something that was totally otherworldly.  The Black Hole has an extremely powerful reverb engine that is easily tweakable.

### Tech21 FlyRig - Cali

Good drive and decent interface for direct to board recording.

## Recording Gear

My home studio is pretty basic:

* Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 as my audio capture
* Ableton Live Intro as my DAW
* Zoom H2N for live capture and field recordings
* Occasional use of Audacity as a secondary DAW
