Firstly I am impressed that you've bothered to read this far.  :-)

## Homemade Guitars

I have three guitars I've made with some help from my dad when I was younger.   These guitars have been mostly retired and I still own #2, #3, and #4.  I mostly share this info because it is part of my musical past.

### String Thing #1

This was the first attempt at building a stringed instrument for me to play.  I remember being mostly disappointed with it because I couldn't get it to sound like an electric guitar.

#### Vitals

* Built around 1980
* Acrylic plastic nut and bridge
* Fretless bridge pieces could be moved up and down the body
* Wide neck
* This "guitar" was at one point sawed in half and had a hinge inserted in the gap in the misguided attempt to add a tremolo like feature. Eventually laminated back together.
* Deceased.  I honestly can't recall what happened to this instrument.

### String Thing #2

This was the first real guitar.  It was modeled vaguely on a Fender Stratocaster.  I used this during the first few years of Bits Of Food.  It had a distinctive sound, bright, thin, and nasally.  It was also quite a challenge to play because it had a long scale which puts the frets further apart but my hands are not particularly large and at 16 were even smaller.

### Vitals

* Built around 1982
* 7.8 lbs
* 22 frets
* 28 1/2 inches from nut to bridge.  An attempt to increase the number of frets.  Little did we know that making the neck longer simply spaced the frets apart further; a critical mistake considering my hand size.
* brass nut
* t-bar re-enforced neck
* two piece guitar made from oak 
* maple fret board
* 3 single coil fender strat style pickups
* each pickup can be separately turned on or off giving 9 combinations
* separate switch to put pickups into "out of phase"
* active gain electronics

### String Thing #3

This guitar was my main guitar in Bits Of Food.  It was a good size for me and was lighter in weight partly in relation to the weight of the earlier guitars..  The two humbucking pickups provided a good solid sound and it had a built in compressor for even more boost.

#### Vitals

* Built around 1983
* 5.8 lbs - lighter to address some of the weight considerations with Guitar 1 22 frets 25 inches from nut to bridge. 
* Smaller to address the neck length problems from Guitar 1
* Neck taken from a cannibalized cheap commercial guitar
* Laminated body with pieces of oak, mahogany and some other woods
* One PAF style humbucking pickup at the neck position and one Lawerence pickup at bridge.
* Built in compression electronics

### String Thing #4

I can't really remember the origin of this guitar.  I believe actually it was more motivated by my dad than anything.  We were both fascinated by the Chapman Stick which partially explains the appearance.  It was also an attempt to use tremolo which is Fender Stratocaster styled.   I have used this guitar mostly in situations where I was playing in one of the noise venues (i.e. with The Nihilist Spasm Band or at the No Music Festivals).  It tends to be a good guitar for just wailing on.  It is the only one of the guitars I built that has been in active service in the past 20 years.

#### Vitals

* Built around 1988
* 7.0 lbs - weight increased by artificially attaching a metal plate at the bottom of the guitar to help balance it
* 22 frets
* 24 1/4 inches from nut to bridge
* Gotch machine heads
* Bone nut
* Maple fret board
* One piece mahogany body with a separate piece of wood added later for a strap
* One single coil fender Stratocaster style pickup at neck and One Bartolini pickup at neck position.  Bartolini pickup wired to be tapped
* Fender style tremolo system
