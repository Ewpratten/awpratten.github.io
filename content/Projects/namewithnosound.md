About

Name With No Sound is a musical collaboration between myself and Mark Favro. 

Our music is made up of pre-composed and live elements.  Mark plays keyboards.  I play guitar.  Both of us contribute to the pre-composed backing tracks over which each person plays live.

Our music is all original and draws from our musical backgrounds and interests.  The results could be described as electronic and ambient. 

We meet roughly once a week to experiment with various musical ideas.  Some of those ideas serve as a starting point from which we further refine into a composition. 

In addition, Mark is an accomplished filmmaker and our music has been used in conjunction with Mark's videos both in a live setting and on various internet websites such as Youtube.
